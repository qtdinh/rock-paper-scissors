# rock-paper-scissors

## About
This was a short exercise from The Odin Project to practice some JavaScript. This program prompts the user to input either rock, paper or scissors (case-insensitive) five times. It keeps the score. When the result is a victory, the winner gets 1 point. If it's a tie, both participants get points. The computer chooses between the three options randomly.

## What I learned
1. Familiarization with JavaScript syntax.
2. How to randomly select items out of an array.
3. Case-insensitive input.
