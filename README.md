# rock-paper-scissors

## About
This was a short project from The Odin Project to practice some JavaScript. This program prompts the user to input either rock, paper or scissors (case-insensitive) five times. It keeps the score. When the result is a victory, the winner gets 1 point. If it's a tie, both points are given. The computer chooses between the three options randomly.

## Update
The project has been updated to include buttons, so the player can play 5 rounds of Rock, Paper and Scissors as much as they please without having to use the console. The site displays points and whoever won. When either side reaches 5 points, it will announce a winner.

## What I learned
1. Familiarization with JavaScript syntax.
2. How to randomly select items out of an array.
3. Case-insensitive input.

Update:
1. Utilizing DOM methods.
2. Modifying HTML elements with JavaScript.
3. Creating new branches in Git.
4. Merging branches in Git.
